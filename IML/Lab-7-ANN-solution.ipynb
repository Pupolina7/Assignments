What's the difference between deep learning and normal machine learning?\n","<span style=\"color:blue\">\n","   \n","    1- Adding more data for traditional ML algorithms, won't improve\n","\t  the performance and the learning curve will saturate (plateau), but for DL, you can get better performance.\n","\t<br/>2- There's no feature extraction step in a lot of cases like in CNN\n","\t<br/>3- It needs high computational power in training.\n","2. How does a neural network with no hidden layers and one output neuron compare to a logistic/linear regression?\n","<span style=\"color:blue\"> There's no difference. NN with no hidden layers is a perceptron which has the same architecture of logistic/linear regression. If the activation function in the output layer is linear and loss is mse then it is linear regression. If the activation function in the output layer is sigmoid and the loss is the logloss then it is logistic regression.\n","3.

Can the perceptron find a non-linear decision boundary?\n","<span style=\"color:blue\"> No, as long as the logits (logOdds which is the input to the sigmoid function) is a linear combination of the input variables then it can only find a linear decision boundary.\n","5. In a multi-hidden layers network, what's the need of a non-linear activation function?\n","<span style=\"color:blue\"> To capture the non-linear patterns in the relation between the input and the output.\n","6. Is random weight assignment better than assigning same weights to the units in the hidden layer.\n","<span style=\"color:blue\"> Yes, as assigning the same weight to the unit won't learn anything from the error signal propagated from the output layer as the error signal value depends on the value of the weight itels, so the hidden layer before the output layer all of the units will get the same value of the error and they will change to the same value as well and same for all units in the network.\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TrTIrPum6nGh"},"source":["## 1) Theory: Feed Forward Neural Network\n","\n","An artificial neural network consists of:\n","\n","- Input Layer  \n","- Hidden Layer(s)\n","- Output Layer\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"./assets/simple_network.png\" alt=\"drawing\" style=\"width:400px;\"/>\n","</center>\n","\n","The layers consist of units, typically called \"neurons\".
